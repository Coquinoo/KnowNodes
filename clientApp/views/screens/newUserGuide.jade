    h2 P2P Science Alliance Guideline

    p The purpose of P2P Science Alliance is to help researchers and scientists create cross-network project-oriented alliances.
      |Some recommendations:

    ol When creating a new connection, it's very important that you'll write a full, coherent
      |sentence explaining how the two peers you link are connected.
    ol Be descriptive and neutral.
    ol Avoid using jargon, or highly specialised words in that connecting sentence - always keep in mind your
      |description will be read by a non-expert.
    ol Interact with respect and civility to other contributors.
    ol Be bold! We tend to be humble about how much we can contribute, but in fact, each contribution makes
      |the network stronger.

    br
    h3 What we are not.
    ol We are not LinkedIn or Facebook - We a social network, we do not run recommendation algorithms to connect people,
      |this place is for people to share their connections with each other.
    ol We are not Wikipedia - We are not an Encyclopedia, and though we have strong integration
      |and support for linking to wikipedia articles, the place to debate about the articles themselves is in Wikipedia.
    ol We are not a news aggregator - Sharing interesting links is a great way to spread knowledge,
      |but in Knownodes a proper link description is the most important thing.

    ol In case you disagre with someone's connection, you can create a parallel connection, comment or vote on it.
