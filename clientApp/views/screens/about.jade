     h3(style="margin:0px") Knownodes is a new way to create and explore connections.
       | It allows regular people to make the web a better place by providing context to knowledge, concepts and ideas.
     h3 It's a great way to share knowledge between friends and colleagues, and discover new things!
     br

     h3(style="margin:0px")  Knownodes is unique in allowing different perspectives on connections to be displayed in the same time.
       | For instance, if you are unsatisfied with a connection someone made, you can just create one of your own. Both will be displayed.
       | You can also peer-review connections made by others by voting or commenting on them.
     br

     h3(style="margin:0px") Beyond the technology itself, we also organise &nbsp;
       a(href="http://stps.co/r/0EBJTGN/") workshops in labs and organisations.
       | We would be happy to facilitate or help you organise one for your own community.
       | Three times a year we organise a hackathon where we work together to add new features to the system.
